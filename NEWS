NEWS for cliapp
===============


Version 0.5, released 2011-02-13
--------------------------------

* Catches exceptions and prints error message, instead of having the Python
  interpreter do a stack trace.
* Support more traditional Unix command line filter behavior: read from
  stdin if no arguments are given, or a dash ('-') is given as the filename.
* Count files and lines in files.
* New options: --output, --log, --log-level.


Version 0.4, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Bugfix: Subclasses can now actually set the application version, so
  that --version works.
