NEWS for cliapp
===============


Version 0.7, released 2011-03-12
--------------------------------

* Add configuration file support.
* API change: all settings are now in a class of their own, and are accessed
  via `app.settings`, e.g., `app.settings['output']`. See the `cliapp.Settings`
  class. This change breaks old code, sorry. But since I am still the only
  user, nobody minds.
* The callback setting type is now gone.
* Application name can now be set via the Application class's initializer
  (optional `progname` argument), or by assigning to 
  `cliapp.Settings.progname`. If not set explicitly, it is set from
  `sys.argv[0]`.

Version 0.6, released 2011-02-19
--------------------------------

* New option types: list of strings, choice of strings, callback.
* New standard option: --dump-setting-names.
* Python profiling support: automatically if the right environment variable
  is set. If the process's argv[0] is 'foo', and 'FOO_PROFILE' is set, then
  profiling happens.
* Documentation improvments.

Version 0.5, released 2011-02-13
--------------------------------

* Catches exceptions and prints error message, instead of having the Python
  interpreter do a stack trace.
* Support more traditional Unix command line filter behavior: read from
  stdin if no arguments are given, or a dash ('-') is given as the filename.
* Count files and lines in files.
* New options: --output, --log, --log-level.


Version 0.4, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Bugfix: Subclasses can now actually set the application version, so
  that --version works.
