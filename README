README for cliapp
=================

cliapp is a Python framework for Unix-like command line programs.
The scaffoling to set up a command line parser, open each input
file, read each line of input, etc, is the same in each program.
Only the logic of what to do with each line differs.

See the API documentation on the `doc` subdirectory for details
(or see <http://code.liw.fi/cliapp/docs/> for a pre-formatted version).

Example
-------

See the file `example.py` for an example of how to use the framework.
