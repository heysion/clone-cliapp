README for cliapp
=================

cliapp is a Python framework for Unix-like command line programs.
The scaffoling to set up a command line parser, open each input
file, read each line of input, etc, is the same in each program.
Only the logic of what to do with each line differs.

See the API documentation on the `doc` subdirectory for details
(or see <http://code.liw.fi/cliapp/docs/> for a pre-formatted version).

Example
-------

See the files `example.py` and `example2.py` for examples of how to 
use the framework.

Version numbering
-----------------

cliapp version numbers are of the form `API.DATE`, where `API` starts
at 1, and gets incremented if the application API changes in an 
incompatible way. `DATE` is the date of the release.

The `cliapp.__version__` string is set to `1.DEVEL` in version control,
to differentiate development versions and release versions.
